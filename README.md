# Beginner-Portfolio
A basic Beginner level portfolio made for my collge project using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
This is a simple website with smooth animation and and google and apple inspired UI elements.
This is a Frontend only website and for the Contact Me i've used formspree.
I took the insipration for my homepage from matthis garnier,
https://matthisgarnier.webflow.io/  .
And then my about me page i took inspiration from https://youtu.be/ldwlOzRvYOU?si=kA0h1TUpjc86brVf .
The rest of the page i made in React and then used bolt Ai and v0(Vercel) to convert into HTML and CSS as writing the entire webpages in HTML and CSS is Tedious.
I wanted to make it a single scroll website but iam too lazy :P.
This is a really cohesive and Premium and i encourage to take inspiration from my website.
I'll hosting this and i'll update my link here.
